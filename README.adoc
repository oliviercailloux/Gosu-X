== Round
A round consists in three phases.

== Actions
Alternate playing one action until a player passes, then the remaining player takes â‰¤ 3 actions more.

* Play: 
** From left to right
** Troop: costs 0 iff some same-clan Troop or no distinct-clan Troop; 2 otherwise
** Hero or Immortal: requires some same-clan recruit of each inferior level; requires at least as many recruits on each inferior levels than number of recruits on the level played
* Shift:
** with non identical name
** activation tokens on the shifted card go to the used player zone
** apply effect
* Activate: one token for one card; two tokens for three cards; or one token to activate a card effect.
* Pass: only if no activation token left

== Great Battle
* Military strength: Wondrous token counts for half point, Veterans count double if tokenized
* Each highest military take a Supremacy token
* If someone has two, the game ends.
